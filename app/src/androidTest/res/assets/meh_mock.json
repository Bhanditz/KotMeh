      "title": "Vacuumly Asked Questions",
      "body": "*The Dyson DC41 again? Haven't you guys sold this before?*\r\n\r\nYes. [This one time](https://meh.com/deals/dyson-dc-41), [this other time](https://meh.com/deals/dyson-dc41-animal-or-animal-complete--refurbished-), and [this time, too](https://meh.com/deals/dyson-dc-41-1). Today makes four times.\r\n\r\n*Is it because you don't have anything else to sell?*\r\n\r\nNo. It's because people like vacuums. Dysons and Roombas have always been the most requested items from our customers, dating back to our Woot days. \r\n\r\nAnd it's because we're set up to be kind of an impulse-buy store, but a Dyson DC41 is on the pricey side for an impulse buy, even at this price. If we can, we like to give people a little while to think about it before the next time it comes around.\r\n\r\n*What's the difference between these three options?*\r\n\r\nThe Dyson DC41 **Base** model includes a Dyson DC41. The **Animal** model includes a tangle-free turbine head. The **Animal Frankenstein** model includes a bundle of other tools we put together. Check the specs for details.\r\n\r\n*Did you love one of your parents more than the other?*\r\n\r\nNot more than, but differently than. Our mother was warm and affectionate. Her love was a blanket she wrapped around us to keep the cold world from chilling our little noses. Our father was proud, strong, never unkind, but emotionally distant and hard to embrace. It wasn't until adulthood that we realized why: because he was a saguaro cactus. Hiding that fact from us was the way he showed his love.\r\n\r\n*I'm seeing this vacuum cleaner for the first time. Should I buy it?*\r\n\r\nIf you want it? Probably. But if you'd rather think it over, you'll probably have another shot at it before too long. We've kinda got a hookup with refurbed Dysons, so they pop up here pretty regularly. Just ask our good friends in the forum. They'll tell you all about it, sometimes in very colorful terms. \r\n\r\n*Which Holy Roman Emperor engaged in a lifelong quest to discover the legendary Philosopher's Stone, and once had a horoscope prepared for him by Nostradamus?*\r\n\r\n[Rudolf II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor).\r\n\r\n*Do you have any animated GIFs that can inspire me to work out more?*\r\n \r\n![no agony, no bragony][1]\r\n\r\n*Do I really need a vacuum cleaner?*\r\n\r\nWe're pretty sure that people who have to ask that question need vacuum cleaners worst of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://res.cloudinary.com/mediocre/image/upload/v1428379743/bv0hmdotjr9mbmblr3ef.gif"
